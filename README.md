# UNP-Project-with-Power-BI_US-Pollution
Completed this Project as a Part of my Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP).

Key Highlights:

1) Analyzed air quality data concerning NO2, O3, SO2, and CO pollutants in the United States. Delivered essential details such as average levels, maximum readings, and Air Quality Index (AQI), enabling evaluation of regional implications.

2) Processed and refined the dataset by rectifying missing values, eradicating duplicates, and ensuring uniformity in data structure. Utilized Power Query Editor for systematic data preparation.

3) Formulated key performance indicators (KPIs) utilizing DAX functions to derive average and maximum AQI values categorized by State and Time.

4) Developed an interactive dashboard incorporating date, city, and state slicers. Constructed a visual representation through a stacked bar chart showcasing the Average AQI by State. Utilized Trends and Forecast analysis for predicting 5-year trends. Analyzed high pollution peaks, offering valuable insights into air quality trends.

5) Contributed significantly to creating intuitive user interfaces and impactful data visualization techniques.
